# 🧠 EEG Analysis Module: Technical Deep Dive

## 1. Overview
The EEG Analysis Module is designed to detect early signs of cognitive decline (MCI/Alzheimer's) by analyzing the "spectral slowing" of brainwave activity. It processes raw EEG signals, extracts frequency-domain biomarkers, and uses a Machine Learning model to predict a risk score.

## 2. Workflow Architecture

1.  **Input**: The system accepts EEG data in `.edf` (European Data Format) or `.csv` format.
2.  **Preprocessing**:
    *   **Resampling**: All data is resampled to **256 Hz** to ensure consistency.
    *   **Windowing**: The continuous signal is sliced into **4-second windows** with a 2-second overlap (50%).
    *   **Filtering**: A bandpass filter (0.5 - 50 Hz) is applied to remove DC drift (low freq noise) and power line interference (high freq noise).
3.  **Feature Extraction**: For each window and each channel, we calculate specific biomarkers (detailed below).
4.  **Inference**: A pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier** analyzes the feature vector and outputs a probability (0.0 to 1.0).
5.  **Aggregation**: The probabilities from all windows are averaged to produce the final session risk score.

## 3. Feature Extraction (What we calculate)

We extract features primarily from the **Frequency Domain** using **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** via Welch's Method.

### 📊 Frequency Bands & Significance

| Band | Frequency Range | Cognitive Significance | In Alzheimer's/MCI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Delta** | 0.5 - 4 Hz | Deep sleep, unconsciousness. | **INCREASES** (Pathological slowing) |
| **Theta** | 4 - 8 Hz | Drowsiness, meditation, idling. | **INCREASES** (Key marker of decline) |
| **Alpha** | 8 - 13 Hz | Relaxed wakefulness, closing eyes. | **DECREASES** (Loss of "idle" rhythm) |
| **Beta** | 13 - 30 Hz | Active thinking, focus, alert. | **DECREASES** (Reduced cognitive processing) |
| **Gamma** | 30 - 45 Hz | High-level information processing. | **DECREASES** (Disrupted connectivity) |

### 🧮 Key Calculated Features

1.  **Absolute Band Power**: The total energy in each frequency band (uV²/Hz).
2.  **Relative Band Power (RBP)**: The percentage of total brain activity that falls into a specific band.
    *   *Formula*: `Power(Band) / Total_Power(0.5-45Hz)`
    *   *Why?* Absolute power varies by person/skull thickness. Relative power is normalized and comparable across patients.
3.  **Clinical Ratios**:
    *   **Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR)**: `Theta / Beta`. High TBR indicates slow-wave dominance (attention deficit/decline).
    *   **Delta/Alpha Ratio (DAR)**: `Delta / Alpha`. High DAR is strongly correlated with ischemic stroke and vascular dementia.
4.  **Time-Domain Stats**: Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis (to detect artifacts/noise).

## 4. The "Spectral Slowing" Phenomenon

The core biological principle our model relies on is **Spectral Slowing**.

*   **Healthy Brain**: Dominant activity in **Alpha (8-13Hz)** and **Beta (13-30Hz)** during wakefulness. Fast, efficient processing.
*   **Cognitive Decline**: The brain "slows down." Power shifts **leftward** on the spectrum.
    *   Alpha/Beta power drops 📉
    *   Delta/Theta power rises 📈

**The Model's Job**: To detect this specific "shift left" pattern in the high-dimensional feature space.

## 5. Model & Training

*   **Algorithm**: **Random Forest Classifier** (Ensemble of Decision Trees).
*   **Why Random Forest?**
    *   Handles non-linear relationships well (e.g., the complex interaction between Theta and Alpha).
    *   Robust to noise and outliers (common in EEG).
    *   Provides "feature importance" (tells us which bands mattered most).
*   **Training Data**: The model is trained on labeled datasets (e.g., ADNI, PhysioNet) containing EEG recordings from:
    *   Class 0: Healthy Controls (HC)
    *   Class 1: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) / Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

### Prediction Logic
1.  The model receives a feature vector (e.g., `[Delta_Rel: 0.4, Theta_Rel: 0.3, Alpha_Rel: 0.1, ...]`).
2.  It traverses its decision trees. Example logic branch:
    *   *Is Theta > 0.25?* **YES**
    *   *Is Alpha < 0.15?* **YES**
    *   *Is TBR > 2.5?* **YES**
    *   -> **Vote: High Risk**
3.  The ensemble averages the votes to produce a probability (e.g., `0.85`).
4.  **Final Output**:
    *   **Probability**: `0.85` (85% confidence in impairment pattern)
    *   **Risk Level**: `High` (>70%)

## 6. Summary for Teammates

> "Our EEG module takes raw brain signals, chops them into 4-second pieces, and calculates how much energy is in the 'slow' waves (Delta/Theta) vs. the 'fast' waves (Alpha/Beta). It uses a Random Forest model to check if the brain is showing the specific 'slowing down' pattern characteristic of early dementia. If the model sees high Theta and low Alpha, it flags a high risk score."
